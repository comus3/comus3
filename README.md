![Profile Image](profileImg.jpg)

I'm C√¥me Plantin-Carrenard, a 23-year-old student. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Computer Science at ECAM. I am deeply fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks and I'm actively pursuing self-guided courses to expand my knowledge in these areas.


## My Passions and Skills

- üñ•Ô∏è Programming: I love to code in Python, C#, C++, and Java. Solving problems and creating applications in these languages is my forte.

- ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence: I have a special affinity for AI, neural networks, and the realm of data science. I explore these domains on my own to learn and grow. I even made my own framework in c.

- üì¶ Projects: I'm a project enthusiast and enjoy working on a variety of ideas alongside my studies. Each project is an opportunity for me to learn and enhance my skills.

- üë∑ Simulations: I'm still a future engineer, I am passionated by physics and the science of generating models that approximate reality
 
## Favorite Projects 

Here are a few of my favorite projects:

- [FFT-Filter Project](https://github.com/comus3/FFT-Filter): A project I created for applying FFT filters to signals. 

- [A Real Hello World](https://github.com/comus3/A_real_hello_world): A unique perspective on the traditional "Hello World."

Feel free to explore these projects to learn more about my work!

## Additional Information

I'd like to express my gratitude to my computer science professor, [Quentin Lurkin](https://github.com/qlurkin), for their invaluable guidance.

Most of the stuff I make is on a MIT liscence so everybody is free to use and create things with my code. I'm an open source kind of guy
