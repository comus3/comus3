I'm C√¥me Plantin-Carrenard, a 22-year-old student. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Computer Science at ECAM. I am deeply fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks and I'm actively pursuing self-guided courses to expand my knowledge in these areas.

I've been on GitHub for 0 years and during this time, I've made 281 commits across 13 repositories.

## My Passions and Skills

- üñ•Ô∏è Programming: I love to code in Python, C#, C++, and Java. Solving problems and creating applications in these languages is my forte.

- ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence: I have a special affinity for AI, neural networks, and the realm of data science. I explore these domains on my own to learn and grow.

- üì¶ Projects: I'm a project enthusiast and enjoy working on a variety of ideas alongside my studies. Each project is an opportunity for me to learn and enhance my skills.

- üë∑ Simumations: I'm still a future engineer, I am passionated by physics and the science of generating models that approximate reality

## Favorite Projects

Here are a few of my favorite projects:

- [FFT-Filter Project](https://github.com/comus3/FFT-Filter): A project I created for applying FFT filters to signals.

- [A Real Hello World](https://github.com/comus3/A_real_hello_world): A unique perspective on the traditional "Hello World."
